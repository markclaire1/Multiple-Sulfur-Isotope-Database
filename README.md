A compiled and curated table of multiple sulfur isotope measurements from throughout the geological record, with a primary focus on minimally-altered sedimentary rocks.

This version is under-development and contains extensive (but incomplete) metadata about each sample. I would very much like to fix, merge, add to, and maintain this dataset, but do not have the time/funding at the present moment.  I would be very welcome for any updates/pull requests and am very open to colloboration with anyone who has (or can suggest a keen student with) time to spare on making this product more useful to the community.

This database was compiled for the 2024 Treatise on Geochemistry chapter "Mass independent fractionation processes in the atmosphere" and for the figures and analysis within. While that effort is unfortunately closed source (available upon email request to the author), we wanted to ensure the data would be available for others to use/add to.

The original data sources are of course the cited articles, but this current compilation is predominantly a merging (and in some cases, error fixing) of three previous compilations:
1) The Global Sedimentary Sulfur Database
2) The Compilation of Uveges, et al. 2023
3) An unpublished personal compilation created and maintained predominantly by James Farquhar and Aubrey Zerkle.

My primary addition to this database is a column labeled 'NON_ATM_FLAG'. This is an attempt at a curated (but admiditely somewhat subjective in places) list of any indication that the multiple sulfur isotope data might not reflect an atmospheric source. There are entries for non-sedimentary rock types, alteration as indicated by the authors (or by the underlying minerology), minerals interpreted as detrital, as well as outliers.  Only data marked 'OK' in this column were used in the TOG Chapter.

No systemmatic attempt was made to distinguish between cap Delta values generated using linear or logarithmic values, as for the small delta values encountered in the rock record, all definitions provide indentical values lower than associated analytical uncertaintites (Endo et al. 2024, in review, Chemical Geology)
